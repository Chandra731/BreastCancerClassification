# Breast Cancer Classification with SVM

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. The data is from the Scikit-learn's load_breast_cancer dataset.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/brucelee31072004/SupportVectorMachines`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install scikit-learn pandas`
3. **Run the script:** `python breast_cancer_classification.py`

## Key Points

* Explores both a basic SVM model and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
* Evaluates model performance using confusion matrix and classification report.
* Provides insights into the importance of hyperparameter tuning for SVM.

## Future Work

* Experiment with different kernels (linear, polynomial) and hyperparameters.
* Explore other classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and compare performance.
